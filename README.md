# Python-and-Tableau-Project-

This was our final projet for the data analytics immersion section. I took a dataset from Kaggle and cleaned and analyzed the data for a hypothesis related to Sepsis.
Througout this project I performed the cleaning and organizing of a large data set and then performed cluster and scatter analysis to determine any relationships between the measured sepsis criteria. For the breakdown of the data you can check out the attached document Sepsis Dataset Overview. This breaks down the original dataset that was then combined with a CDC sepsis by state dataset to look at geographical breakdown for the year 2020 as well. Findings and overview we presented in a tableau presentation.
